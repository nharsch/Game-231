# Introduction to Recording
---
## Introduction to Signal Path
- When recording, signal starts at a transducer (usually microphone), ends at some recording medium
- During playback, signal starts at recorded media, ends at a transducer (speaker)
- Signal can be manipulated or rerouted at any point in this path
---
### Recording Signal Flow

### Playback Signal Flow

## Microphones
- Convert acoustic audio to electrical signals
- Types of mics
  - Dynamic
    - Much like a speaker wired in reverse
    - Rugged
    - Proximity effect: sounds bassier when closer to source
  - Condenser
    - Much more sensistive to high frequencies
    - Usually has a wider dynamic range
    - No proximity effect
    - Requires "phantom power"
  - Other less common
    - Ribbon
    - Piezo
---
### Analog vs Digital Mics
- Analog mics
  - (usually) have XLR connectors
![](https://nigelharsch.com/Game-231/assets/xlr_connector.jpg)
---
- Analog mics
  - need a preamp and a Analog-to-Digital converter
    - usually bundled together as an "interface"
![](https://nigelharsch.com/Game-231/assets/audio-interface.jpg)
---
- Digital Mics
  - have a build in Analog-to-Digital converter
  - Usually have USB connection
  - If it has a XLR connection, that is analog

### Mic directionality
![](https://nigelharsch.com/Game-231/assets/mic_patterns.jpeg)
---
### Mic directionality
- Omni
  - picks up all directions equally
- Cardiod
  - Picks up in front of mic, rejects behind mic
- Figure 8
  - Picks up in front and behind, rejects sides
---
### Mic Techniques for recording Voice Overs
- Most mics sound best 3"-12" from mouth
- Use pop screen or filter
  - Else, turn the mic slightly away from actor
- Isolate mic stand from actor movements
  - IE: don't put on desk if actor is using the desk to hold a script
- If the mic has a "low cut" swtich, use it

### Common Room problems

---
### Common Voice Over fixes
- Sibilance
  - Pop filter
  - De-esser
- Room resonance
  - Use EQ notch
- Mouth sounds
  - Give actor some water
  - use judicious editing
- Even volume
  - use checkerboard edits to increse quiet levels
    - can result in uneven noise floors
  - compression and limiting
---
## Some more useful Sound Effects for cleaning up audio
- [Example audio file](https://nigelharsch.com/Game-231/assets/noisy_VO.wav)
---
### Noise Gate
- reduces volume under a certain point
- LAB: apply noise gate
---
### Noise Reduction
- complex algorithm
- DeNoiser is the most user friendly
- LAB: apply noise reduction
---
### De-Esser
- Compression applied to high frequencies only
- LAB: apply De-Esser
---
