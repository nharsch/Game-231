### Announcements
- How is Voice Over project going?
  - I put up the missing asset sheet
  - Has anyone rented equipment yet?
---
### Reading Review
- [Level 7 - Voice Over](https://nigelharsch.com/Game-231/The%20Essential%20Guide%20to%20Game%20Audio%20Book%20Notes/#level-7-voice-over)

# Introduction to Non Destructive Editing
AKA Multitracking
---
## A review of Signal Flow Concept
![](https://nigelharsch.com/Game-231/assets/Signal%20Flow.png)
                <!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->
---
## Mixing
- *Mixing* allows us to combine multiple audio signals into one.
- Most DAWs have a mixing section that resembles a hardware mixer
  - Each vertical column handles adjustments to one signal
  - Usually includes a *Master* fader for _overall_ adjustments
![](https://nigelharsch.com/Game-231/assets/mixer-channel-strip.png)
---
## Quick intro to Pro Tools
- Industry standard DAW
- Maybe the least "beginner friendly"
- A knowledge of pro tools will translate to most other DAWs
---
### Lab: Fire up Pro Tools, test audio
- Create 4 stereo input tracks
  - Track -> Create Track
    - 4, Stereo, Audio Track, Ticks, Audio
- Create Master Fader
  - Track -> Create Track
    - 1, Stereo, Master Fader, Ticks, Master
- Put 2 audio files into the project
  - Can drag and drop onto track
  - Or File -> Import
    - will create a new track
- Play sounds
  - Debug output if none playing
---
### Non Destructive Editing Concepts
- audio "clips"
  - can be sliced and moved, orignal audio file remains unchanged
- audio mixing
  - multiple sounds levels can be adjusted and combined into one audio stream
- real time effects
  - effects aren't "printed", but applied on playback
- Automation
  - change parameters over time
    - important for understanding FMOD
---
### Lab: Mix sounds
- Open mixer window,
  - Is in separate window
  - Pro tip: Window -> Arrange
- Adjust volume of channels
  - Volume is the vertical "slider"
- Adjust master
---
### Adding Effects in Non Destructive DAWs
- In Audition we "printed" effects onto the clip
- In Non Destructive editing, we think of audio effects as a transformation
- Effects can be "chained" into each other
  - Like guitar effects
![](https://nigelharsch.com/Game-231/assets/guitar-effects-chain.png)
---
### Lab: Add an insert effect
- On track lane or mixer column, click empty slot under "INSERTS"
- Select an effect
- Playback sound
- enable and disable
---
### Inserts vs Sends
- Inserts apply effect to one input channel "inline"
- Sends allow us to "route" multiple input channels to another channel
  - Often used for time based effects like reverb and delay
  - Sounds more natural, cuts down on resources
- Sends use an audio "bus" to route sounds to effect
  - effectively "splits" the audio stream into two, one goes to send, one goes down channel strip as usual
![](https://nigelharsch.com/Game-231/assets/Insert%20vs%20Send.png)
---
### Lab: Create an effects send
- Create Aux Input Track (to receive sound)
  - Track -> New
  - 1, Stereo, Aux Input, Ticks, Effect Send
- Assign bus input on Effect Send
  - Under "I/O", select "Bus 1-2"
- Add bus to sends to input tracks
  - Under "sends", select "Bus 1-2"
---
### Other uses for buses
- Creating "stems" or "submixes"
  - Send all the drums to one bus, mix the overall drums as one channel
- Routing monitor mixes for live performers
- Routing out to physical hardware and back
- Mostly, we won't need them for our purposes
---
## Automation
- Adjusts parameters over time
- Usually using "automation lanes" and "automation curves"
---
### Lab: add volume automation to track
- on track lane, click small triangle in lower left corner
  - add volume automation curve
  - add effects send automation curve
---
### Lab: Editing clips
- select a region of the a clip
- ctrl+e (or right click -> separate)
- move new clip around
---
### Lab: Clip Gain
- Click on slider icon on lower left of clip
- adjust volume
---
### Lab: Apply clip level normalization
- click on clip
- Audio Suite -> Other -> Normalize
---
### Lab: Looping
- right click clip -> loop
---
## Pro Tools Wrap up
- We'll use Pro Tools for our next assignment
- Familiarize youself with it as best you can
- Many concepts from Pro Tools will be needed to understand FMOD
---
## Other (arguably better) DAWs
...If you end up hating it
- Cubase
  - More cutting edge features than Pro Tools
- REAPER
  - Free to try, inexpensive to buy
  - My go to for editing podcasts, voice overs, other non musical projects
- Logic
  - Focused on music production
  - More beginner friendly
  - Includes library of Software Instruments
- Ableton
  - Focused on live performance and music production
  - Very popular
  - My go to for music production
---
## Next Week
- [Project 1 - Game Scene Remix](https://canvas.apu.edu/courses/45722/assignments/798503) (due 3/15)
- Reading
  - Level 9 - Prepping Audio
  - Level 6 - Composing
